Use Genetic Algorithm to identify molecular compositions from the Raman spectrum of a 
heterogeneous organic material.

Direct use of this code requires a Raman spectra database running in the background.

The Genetic Algorithm part is a stand alone module. It can be used as a generic tool to find 
a linear combination of vectors that matches closely to another vector.

This code requires mongodb java driver library and apache math library. I am using mongodb 
driver version 2.11.1 and apache math library 3.3. You can download them from their 
websites.
